# PCB Design and Layout

Turn your idea into a ready-to-manufacture Printed Circuit Board (PCB) prototype in just one day with this hands-on course. Using the open-source KiCad software suite for Electronic Design Automation (EDA), you‚Äôll learn how to create circuit schematics, design a 2-layer PCB, and generate Gerber and IPC-2581 outputs. By the end of the course, you‚Äôll be able to capture a circuit schematic, design and route a circuit board layout, and understand 'some' key principles of good PCB design including an organized Bill of Materials (BoM). You‚Äôll also explore custom part symbols, footprints, and fabrication resources, along with turn-key board manufacturers. *While a basic understanding of circuit theory and electrical fundamentals is helpful, it‚Äôs not required to get started.*

**‚≠êLearning Goal:** Quick start to design, layout, and order your own Printed Circuit Board with KiCAD.

## What is possible? 
 Start your prototypes on a PCB or put your wiring project directly on PCB! Skip the confusion bread-boarding and the mess of point-to-point wiring. Learn EDA concepts to layout a 2-layer printed circuit board.

In class, we use the above examples at approximately 80% completion. The projects above are fully complete, but in class we these projects with 20% of the work unfinished to introduce core concepts in small doses. The scope of the layout expands with each project example. The linked examples represent fully completed projects and are not reflective of the work explicitly covered in class with the instructor.
